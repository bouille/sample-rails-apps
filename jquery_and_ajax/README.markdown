# jQuery and Ajax examples

Run rake app:install to bootstrap some sample data into the app.

Using jQuery instead of prototype in a Rails app is dead easy. This app has an example of how to make will_paginate AJAX-ified, and how to submit a form with AJAX. It's all being done unobtrusively, so the app still works flawlessly if javascript is disabled or unavailable in the browser.
