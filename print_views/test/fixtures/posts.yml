  title: The Print Views apps is now live on github!
  excerpt: This app explains how you can implement print views in your Rails apps. It will use a separate layout for the print views, giving you full control on which stylesheets to include etc.
  body: |
    It uses the mime type functionality in Rails. /posts gives you the 'regular' HTML view, and /posts.print gives you the print view. It's that simple.
    
    The app is available in "the sample rails apps repository on GitHub":http://github.com/leethal/sample-rails-apps/tree.

    Now, go troll elsewhere.
